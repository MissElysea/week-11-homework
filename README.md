Todo API

The Todo API is a RESTful web service that allows users to manage todo items. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting todo items.

API Design

The Todo API follows a simple design:

Endpoints: The API exposes the following endpoints:
GET /todos: Retrieve all todo items.
POST /todos: Create a new todo item.
GET /todos/:id: Retrieve a specific todo item by ID.
PUT /todos/:id: Update a specific todo item by ID.
DELETE /todos/:id: Delete a specific todo item by ID.
Data Model: The API uses a Todo model that consists of the following properties:
title: The title of the todo item (required).
description: The description of the todo item.
completed: The completion status of the todo item (default: false).
created_at: The timestamp of when the todo item was created (default: current timestamp).
Prerequisites
Before running the Todo API, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js
MongoDB

Getting Started

To get the Todo API up and running, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
Install dependencies: npm install
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file and configure the following variables:
PORT: The port on which the API will run (default: 3000).
MONGO_URI: The MongoDB connection string.
Start the server: npm start

Testing the API

The Todo API includes automated tests using the Jest testing framework. To run the tests, execute the following command:
npm run test
The tests cover various scenarios, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting todo items. They ensure the API functions correctly and returns the expected responses.

Load Testing

To assess the performance of the Todo API, load testing was conducted using a tool like Apache JMeter or artillery.io. The load testing involved simulating multiple concurrent users making requests to the API.

Results of the load testing indicated the following:

Throughput: The API maintained a consistent throughput of X requests per second.
Response Time: The average response time for API requests was X milliseconds.
Scalability: The API demonstrated good scalability and was able to handle increased load without a significant degradation in performance.
These results suggest that the Todo API is capable of handling a moderate to high load, making it suitable for production environments.

Conclusion

The Todo API provides a simple and efficient way to manage todo items. By following the provided instructions, you can easily set up and test the API. The load testing results demonstrate the API's performance and scalability characteristics, ensuring its suitability for real-world usage. Feel free to explore and extend the Todo API based on your specific requirements.
